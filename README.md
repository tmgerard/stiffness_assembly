# Stiffness Matrix Assembly

This is my playground for creating a simple scheme for the assembly of a global stiffness matrix. I am currently focusing on the direct stiffness method to understand the basic principles. I would like to progress to improving the code for use in finite element analysis.

The code here will mostly be as minimal as possible for simplicity.

The first version of the code is following the basic implementation procedures found in K.J. Bathe's "Finite Element Procedures."
